# models_from_scratch
Data Science/Machine Learning Models built from scratch for creating a deep theoretical and intuitive understanding

These notebooks contain Machine Learning models that were coded from scratch using mainly numpy arrays. This project was undertaken in order to give me a deep understanding of machine learning models and how they work. 

In each notebook besides for the model there is a toy problem using standard datasets from sklearn, these are not serious datasets or problems, they are there to test the model to make sure it works. 

Besides the building of the model from scratch, in each notebook - using the toy data - there is a short example of basic Data Science best practices (Cross validation, Learning Curves, Learning Rates, Hyperparameter Tuning, etc.). These are in no way comprehensive, I just tried to add something different in each notebook to keep it interesting.

On a more technical note, for all models we follow the standard sklearn api of fit, predict, predict_proba, etc.

Enjoy!
