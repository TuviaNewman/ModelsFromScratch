# models_from_scratch
Data Science/Machine Learning Models built from scratch for creating a deep theoretical and intuitive understanding

These notebooks contain Machine Learning models that were coded from scratch using mainly numpy arrays. This project was undertaken in order to give me a deep understanding of machine learning models and how they work. 

Each notebook starts with a technical explanation of how the model works and then directly dives in to implementing it. Besides that, in each notebook there is a toy problem using standard datasets from sklearn, these are not serious datasets or problems, they are there to test the model to make sure it works. There is also a short example of basic Data Science best practices (Cross validation, Learning Curves, Learning Rates, Hyperparameter Tuning, etc.). These are in no way comprehensive, I just tried to add something different in each notebook to keep it interesting.

On a more technical note, for all models we follow the standard sklearn api (fit, predict, predict_proba, etc). We assume correctness of passed parameters as models were built in order to gain a better understanding and not to serve functional uses in production based systems. 

Enjoy!
