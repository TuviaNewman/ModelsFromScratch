# Notebooks

What is organized here is a selection of the projects that I have done over time. Each one was focused on working on a specific skill and trying to refine it.

### models_from_scratch
These are a set Data Science/Machine Learning Models built from scratch for creating a deep theoretical and intuitive understanding. This includes Neural Networks, Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Boosting Trees and more) and Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, DBSCAN and more).

Enjoy!
