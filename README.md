# Notebooks

What I have here is a small assortent of projects that I have taken on over time. Each one was focused on working on a specific skill and trying to refine it a little.

### models_from_scratch
These are a set Data Science/Machine Learning Models built from scratch for creating a deep theoretical and intuitive understanding. This includes Neural Networks, Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Boosting Trees and more) and Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, DBSCAN and more).

### Britan_traffic_statistics-Fatalities_EDA
In this notebook I dive deep and explore fatal accidents happening in Great Britan. The data for this notebook can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales)

Enjoy!
