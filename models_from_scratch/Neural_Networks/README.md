# Neural Networks

In Simple_Neural_Network we implement a Neural Network with a single hidden layer using tensors and their built in functions. We use this classify basic non-linear artificial data.

In Neural_Network we implement from the ground up a Neural Network and using only numpy arrays. We then go on to use it to do image classification on CIFAR-10.

Enjoy!
