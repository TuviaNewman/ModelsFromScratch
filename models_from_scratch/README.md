# models_from_scratch
Data Science/Machine Learning Models built from scratch for creating a deep theoretical and intuitive understanding

These notebooks contain Machine Learning models that were coded from scratch using mainly numpy arrays or pytorch tensors. This project was undertaken in order to give me a deep understanding of machine learning models and how they work. 
 
The Supervised Learning Folder has six different supervised learning models implementations. There is a more explanatory README in the folder

The Neural Networks has two implementations of a Neural Network. One simpler implementation (where we cheat a little and use some of torch's build in functions) and one where we do a full deep dive and implement from scratch a Neural Network and use it to do image classification on CIFAR-10.

Enjoy!
