# Unsupervised Learning

Each notebook starts with a technical explanation of how the model works and then directly dives in to implementing it. We use toy data to evaluate our models.

Although understanding the data we are working with is very important to do in general, it is the purpose of these notebooks to understand the algorithms by implementing them from scratch, the data is just there to test the model to make sure our model works properly.

Enjoy!
