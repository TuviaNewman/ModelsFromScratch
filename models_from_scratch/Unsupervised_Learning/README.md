# Unsupervised Learning

Each notebook starts with a technical explanation of how the model works and then directly dives in to implementing it. Besides that, in each notebook there is a toy problem using some imported data, these are not serious datasets nor do we pay much attention here to the data. Although understanding the data we are working with is very important to do in general it is the purpose of these notebooks to understand the algorithms by implementing them from scratch, the data is just there to test the model to make sure our model works.

Enjoy!
